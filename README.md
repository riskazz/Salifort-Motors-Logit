### Inspiration  

Answer the following questions would be worthy  
1- Do Exploratory Data analysis to figure out which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)

2- Plot bar charts showing the impact of employee salaries on retention  

3- Plot bar charts showing a correlation between department and employee retention  

4- Now build a logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1  

5- Measure the accuracy of the model
